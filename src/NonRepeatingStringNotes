Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.
Examples:
s = "leetcode"
return 0.
(The "l" is the first character that only appears once in the string, and appears at index 0.)
s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
(The "l" and "o" are repeated, so the first non-repeating character is the "v", which is at index 2.)
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

Input is a string.
Output is an integer: the index of the first non-repeating character in the string.
I need to split the string into an array to process it.
I need to go through each value in that array.
I need to check to see whether each value is repeated elsewhere in the array.
If no, I need to grab the index of that value and return it.
